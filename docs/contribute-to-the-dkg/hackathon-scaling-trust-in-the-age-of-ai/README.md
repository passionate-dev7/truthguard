# Hackathon: Scaling Trust in the Age of AI

### Supported by OriginTrail x Polkadot x Umanitek <a href="#supported-by-origintrail-x-polkadot-x-umanitek" id="supported-by-origintrail-x-polkadot-x-umanitek"></a>

In this hackathon, you will harness the power and versatility of the **OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** to create trusted AI solutions that scale human confidence in machine intelligence. From orchestrating swarms of AI agents, to crowdsourcing real-time web intelligence, to safeguarding creators’ rights and detecting deepfakes — the challenges are bold, urgent, and wide open for your ingenuity.

By weaving provenance, verifiability, and governance directly into the fabric of AI, you’ll be **shaping how trust itself is engineered in digital systems.** This is your chance to not just code, but to redefine the trust architecture of AI for the years ahead.

The most impactful ideas can grow into **lasting partnerships within the OriginTrail and Umanitek ecosystems**, where builders continue shaping the standards of AI safety and digital trust together.

The best projects will share the **$30k reward pool** and **showcase their projects at** [**DKGcon 2025**](https://dkgcon.ai/) — the flagship event of the OriginTrail ecosystem, attracting a **global audience of 60K+** viewers online.
